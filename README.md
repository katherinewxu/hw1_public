# CS 281. Homework 1. Machine Bias

## Setting the environment

Follow the steps below to install anaconda and create the environment for running the starter code.

1. Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/ and install
2. Create a new environment that has all the dependencies installed, e.g., if you decide to name this new
   environment `cs281-hw1`, run the command

```bash
conda create -n cs281-hw1 python=3.8 -y
conda activate cs281-hw1
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Run this from root of the repo.
```

## Starter Code
All starter code related to the first homework is in `hw1.ipynb`. Your code should directly go in this file.

You can include your responses to the free-form questions in the jupyter notebook, or in a separate file you include in the dataset.

## Submission

Running the following will generate hw1.zip which contains hw1.py
```bash
bash make_submission.sh
```
Submit the zip file to Gradescope
